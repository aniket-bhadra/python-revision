# Python Revision Repository
This repository represents continuous learning and regular revision of Python fundamentals.

## Purpose
I use this repository to:
- Practice **core Python concepts**
- Revisit **important and tricky topics**
- Implement **basic algorithms**
- Maintain short, clear examples for **quick revision**

## Scope
- Focused on **fundamentals and logic clarity**
- Includes revision-oriented code, not production-ready implementations
- Written to reinforce understanding of **how and why** the code works
